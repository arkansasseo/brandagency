<p>Case studies or testimonial videos are a great way to increase social proof and influence your target market to move further down the sales funnel.

Here&amp;rsquo;s an example from lifelock :.</p>

<h3>360&amp;deg; &amp; Virtual Reality Videos</h3>
<p>Drone videos can elevate your marketing message. Although we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen many brands, apart from travel brands, investing in drone footage, we expect drone footage to create exceptional video experiences in the future. Drone footage can help create better experiential campaigns for your users, putting you ahead in the competition and creating memorable experiences for your viewers. It will help in improving brand awareness and brand recall because now people can see the &amp;lsquo;reality&amp;rsquo; of your products and services, which is different from augmented and virtual reality. You can use drone videos to capture granular demonstration of your products and services and create authentic experiences for your audience.</p>
<p>While these trends can help provide structure when planning a video marketing campaign for 2020, every brand&amp;rsquo;s plan will look different depending on their marketing and business goals for the year. While the approach should be custom, there are several trends we&amp;rsquo;re seeing emerge, including social media videos, webinars, interactive video and virtual reality.</p>

<h3>Planning Your Video</h3>
<p>Personalized videos can improve performance throughout your sales funnels, from top-of-funnel awareness marketing through loyalty expansion.

This is because traditionally personalized videos are set up using video editing software (such as adobe after effects) and a video personalization platform (such as vidyard).</p>
