Gianni giorgetti director tio. Ch we have integrated rocketium's api with our cms and our journalists are creating quality videos with an experience similar to writing an article.</p>
<p>Case study videos will have to explain to your customers how your company solves past problems and what it can do in the future. Use it to establish your brand&rsquo;s character in front of customers&rsquo; eyes. To do this, you have to conduct research to find out what solutions have been most useful for your users and what challenges your product faces.

<p>Case studies or testimonial videos are a great way to increase social proof and influence your target market to move further down the sales funnel. Your target customers need to know that your product is the perfect solution for their needs. This type of video marketing can help showcase your products while also building trust. Here&rsquo;s an example from lifelock :.</p>
<p>Video marketing can help build trust, which boosts conversions, and sales videos can increase purchase intent by 67%. Video marketing content at this stage can overlap a little bit with content at the middle of the funnel. For example, case studies, testimonials, etc. Are also helpful for&nbsp;closing a new customer. According to vidyard , content at the end of the funnel can&nbsp;include the following:.</p>
<h3>360&deg; &amp; Virtual Reality Videos</h3>
<p>Drone videos can elevate your marketing message. Although we haven&rsquo;t seen many brands, apart from travel brands, investing in drone footage, we expect drone footage to create exceptional video experiences in the future. Drone footage can help create better experiential campaigns for your users, putting you ahead in the competition and creating memorable experiences for your viewers. It will help in improving brand awareness and brand recall because now people can see the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; of your products and services, which is different from augmented and virtual reality. You can use drone videos to capture granular demonstration of your products and services and create authentic experiences for your audience.</p>
<p>While these trends can help provide structure when planning a video marketing campaign for 2020, every brand&rsquo;s plan will look different depending on their marketing and business goals for the year. While the approach should be custom, there are several trends we&rsquo;re seeing emerge, including social media videos, webinars, interactive video and virtual reality.</p>
<h2>Augmented Reality (AR) Videos</h2>

<h3>Planning Your Video</h3>

<p>Videos created using &ldquo;traditional personalization&rdquo; have been pre-rendered in a batch based off of a list of recipients.

They also offer more control over what can be personalized and what the finished product looks like, including the ability to add texture, depth, or other visual effects to personalized elements. This is because traditionally personalized videos are set up using video editing software (such as adobe after effects) and a video personalization platform (such as vidyard).</p>
